This is a not a liscense of Godot

Liscensing is a weird concept to me.
A lot of code was copied directly from tutorials, I have tried to credit out of respect
but I have probably forgotten a few parts, but that's okay because by teaching it in a tutorial setting 
they are implicitly assuming it will be used. I don't believe in the concept
 of patenting code as it is not your creation it is merely a solution
 to solve a problem that anyone could have theoretically figured out. 
Artists seem to be more concerned with their liscenses for some reason, even though technically
digital art is still code and with my previous beliefs as well as the belief that anything that can be
copied for free should be free for anyone I have tried to understand why artists care even on small scales
 and cannot understand it. 

All Code used is implicity shown to the audience under the presumption they will do what they want.

All artwork used is either (under my interpretation) significantly changed from the original
 that I dont need to bother with liscenses or one of a variety of liscenses that allow me to make changes
and use essentially however I want.

These Liscenses are
CC0
CC-ATTRIBUTION (, which includes CC BY 3.0 and CC BY 4.0)


If there is anything I have forgetten I am sorry and I will try to remember where I got it from
Most assets I download are CC0 and/or CC-ATTRIBUTION and other liscenses are stored elsewhere
Except code which is unliscensed or liscensed under MIT which I'm under by using godot addons anyways

If anyone wants their name removed incase this project gets too creepy for them then I guess I'll do it as
long as it isn't a legal issue


I have tried to keep a reference to assets and arts used.

My Humanoid Model:

#The model was rigged by mixamo so I could try and have a system that is more easily model swappable,
even with bad hardcoding practice. 
No animations by mixamo are used as the liscense is too restrictive I have no clear response if I can
put it on a free model that I give to people, which is silly! Ah well procedural animation works better
with ragdolls anyways.


#_SKIN_
CC0 : Vroid
skin is modified from CC0 assets. All taken from the base VRM model type or otther VRM CC0 assets.
Most, if not all, are liscensed by the Vroid company/group whatever

The nipple is some stock image of some dudes nipple that has been so pixelised that it is not
 recognisable which is questionably legal and silly if it is illegal
It is also a dudes nipple which means it technically wouldn't be covered by censorship laws, because
it is the milk ducts that are illegal hahaha thats bullshit but would be funny to say in court....well it looks like a dudes nipple, it says genderless nipple.
but I will provide a link which techincally, while it is the honest thing to do, could get me in more legal trouble, which is silly.

honestly at this point fuck liscenses, its a picture of a nipple....
the text at the bottom may have been removed in the modification process as I only required the aereola and nipple not the surrounding skin


#_ITEMS_
CC0 : Quaternius : Medieval Weapons Pack - Sept 2018
https://opengameart.org/content/lowpoly-medieval-weapons

Note: if other weapons were used they were from the same artist Quaternius and from his CC0 assets


#_CODE_

if artists need it then it feels wrong to not credit the programmers who do most the work in my project anyways
a lot of code is originally from Bastiaan Olij and the other guy who helps with the XR_tools 
(check respective githubs for the other addons) 
So many useful Godot tutorials on youtube.
The 5 or so people that have made rigid ragdoll addons. 
For some reason I had to take a little from each to wrap my head around this shi..
A special mention to Wapit1 as he had made one of these addons and also happened to be very active
on websites where people ask questions about getting active rigid body ragdolls to work in godot
So he was very helpful and I saw his name enough to remember


Other special Mention 
Kenney.nl whose CC0 assets countless times while prototyping, I think none of them made it
into the base minimal project but they might have and if they did it's okay since they are CC0.
