The base scene "TestNPCWar" is for simple demonstrations
you can change the ragdoll type and amount of enemies in the export variable tab
your character is a shitty camera and kinematic body with a rigidBody that badly hovers in front of you
so you can walk into the enemy and bump them (I did this for VR so I didnt care too much about my test NON-VR character)...sometimes it flies away into the abyss
but it works to demonstrate it

various ragdolls located at:
res://addons/rigidRagdoll/Characters/GeneralRagdoll_(...).tscn

(...) replaced with one of the following
Simple = single capsule as foot/leg
CapsuleFoot = single CapsuleBase as foot and no lower legs (upper legs dangle from hips)
Complex = single CapsuleBase as foot and has lower legs that dangle from the upper leg
Stumble = Capsules for both feet, actually can walk

These all use a base code RagdollExtra.gd or RagdollBase.gd (at res://addons/rigidRagdoll/Scripts/...)

to change the mesh you need to get your own skeleton and mesh and move the rest of 
the nodes to under the new skeleton instead of the old one.
(e.g. merge from scene)
Your scene (with YOUR mesh and the ragdoll) will need to tell the dictionary "rigidBodiesFromBones"
what the names of your bones are in its ready function, look at one of the examples to see.
you might have to rename the skeleton Node





Other random scenes
This is a very cut down version of my other project to make an addon, I have tried to minimise it and 
only leave relevant code/scenes but there may be some random things here or there that may seem confusing
