res:\addons\rigidRagdoll:



\Tools\Spatial_XYZ is used to see the orientation of joints to know what angle dimensions refer to,
The angle between RED and BLUE is, the other colour, GREEN.

\Characters:
rigidRagdollNPC.tscn is the main NPC
rigidRagdollVRPC.tscn is the main VR player controller


rigidRagdollNPC.tscn Structure:
Spatial_1			= General reset and set up codes (not much)
-Spatial_2			= Body morphs and colour changes and clothes, etc all things to make the single model look different
--Skeleton			= called SkeletonRagdoll = MOST CODE IS HERE The parent of all the bones and the skeleton that gets deformed by the rigidBodies. 
---Meshes			= the Meshes for the character that we deform with the skeleton (Body and Head)
---RigidBody Bones		= RigidBodies, most are physical bones
---BoneAttachments		= To keep other objects in the right place, e.g Eyes and speechBubble on head
---Joints			= Joints to connect all the rigidBodies
---capsuleBase			= The rigidBody that keeps the rest of the body upright and balanced (most the time), much easier than using feet
----extraAreasForSignals	= Areas that need to move with the NPC fairly stable-y can be put as children of capsuleBase
